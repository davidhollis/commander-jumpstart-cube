This is the landing page for my cube project: a commander cube in the style of [JumpStart][jumpstart]. The aim is to create a fast, fun, varied cube format that operates kind of like a board game.

## How to play

### "Sealed"

Each player randomly selects 4 different [half-decks](/decks), then chooses 2 from that set of four to use for their full deck. Both of the half-deck commanders become partner commanders of the full deck[^1], then that player grabs one [colorless supplement][c-supplement] and shuffles all of their non-commander cards together.

> **For example:** let's say you randomly pull [Neheb, the Eternal][neheb]; [Verazol, the Split Current][verazol]; [Eligeth, Crossroads Augur][eligeth]; and [Gwafa Hazid, Profiteer][gwafa]. You decide that Neheb's mana production would go nicely with a commander like Verazol with its cost of {{< mana x g u >}}. Your deck will be a Temur deck with Neheb and Verazol as partner commanders, and the 98 cards in your starting library will come from Neheb's half-deck, Verazol's half-deck, and the [colorless supplement][c-supplement].

Players then play a normal game of commander (life totals starting at 40, etc.).

[neheb]: /decks/19-burn
[verazol]: /decks/49-kicker
[eligeth]: /decks/07-scry-bal
[gwafa]: /decks/31-wu-control

### "Draft"

Order the players randomly. The first player chooses one half-deck from among the full set. Then the next player chooses from among the remainder, and so on until the last player, who picks **two** half-decks. After that, the remaining players pick their second half-decks in reverse order until everyone has two.

> **For example:** If Abby, Ben, Chris, and Dana are drafting the cube in that order:
>
>   1. First, Abby picks their first half-deck.
>   2. Then, Ben picks their first half-deck.
>   3. Then, Chris picks their first half-deck.
>   4. Then, Dana picks both of their half-decks.
>   5. Then, Chris picks their second half-deck.
>   6. Then, Ben picks their second half-deck.
>   7. Finally, Abby picks their second half-deck.

Each player builds their deck: both of their half-deck commanders become partner commanders of their full deck[^1], then they grab one [colorless supplement][c-supplement] and shuffle all of their non-commander cards together.

## Composition

The cube is still a work in progress, but in its eventual state it will have:

  - 4 identical copies of [the colorless supplement][c-supplement] (though putting more together to support more players isn't out of the question)
  - 50 half-decks:
      - 6 decks of each single color
      - 2 decks of each color pair

For details on how I came to those numbers, [check out the math](/math).

## Following the cube's development

I'll be developing the cube live on Twitch at http://twitch.tv/sconeforgemystic. I'm still working out what the schedule will be, but you can follow me on Twitter ([@SconeforgeMystic](https://twitter.com/sconeforgemystic)) for go-live notifications.
