This is the landing page for my cube project: a commander cube in the style of [JumpStart][jumpstart]. The aim is to create a fast, fun, varied cube format that operates kind of like a board game.

## How to play

Each player randomly selects 4 different [half-decks](/decks), then chooses 2 from that set of four to use for their full deck. Both of the half-deck commanders become partner commanders of the full deck[^1], then that player shuffles adds one [colorless supplement][c-supplement] and shuffles all of their non-commander cards together.

> **For example:** let's say you randomly pull [Neheb, the Eternal][neheb]; [Verazol, the Split Current][verazol]; [Eligeth, Crossroads Augur][eligeth]; and [Gwafa Hazid, Profiteer][gwafa]. You decide that Neheb's mana production would go nicely with a commander like Verazol with its cost of {{< mana x g u >}}. Your deck will be a Temur deck with Neheb and Verazol as partner commanders, and the 98 cards in your starting library will come from Neheb's half-deck, Verazol's half-deck, and the [colorless supplement][c-supplement].

Players then play a normal game of commander (life totals starting at 40, etc.).

[neheb]: /decks/19-burn
[verazol]: /decks/49-kicker
[eligeth]: /decks/07-scry-bal
[gwafa]: /decks/31-wu-control
[c-supplement]: /decks/00-colorless-supplement
[^1]: even if they don't have partner, or if they have "partner with" another commander

## Following the cube's development

I'll be developing the cube live on Twitch at http://twitch.tv/sconeforgemystic. I'm still working out what the schedule will be, but you can follow me on Twitter ([@SconeforgeMystic](https://twitter.com/sconeforgemystic)) for go-live notifications.
