Suit up an attacker (most likely {{< xcard name="Sram, Senior Edificer" label="Sram" />}} himself) and swing for the fences. Sram comes down early and helps draw you into more auras as you stack them up. Note there are some removal spells as potential tutor targets for {{< card Open the Armory >}} and {{< card "Heliod's Pilgrim" >}}.
