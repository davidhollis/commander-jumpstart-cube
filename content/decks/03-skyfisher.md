Based on Wx monarch decks in pauper, this deck aims to build a value engine by repeatedly bouncing small utility artifacts and creatures. There's a few loops you can set up with {{< xcard name="Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle" label="Teshar" />}} and {{< card "Ashnod's Altar" >}} that'll draw the whole deck, and eventually {{< card Field of the Dead >}} can flood the board.
